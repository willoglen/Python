# Python Projects and sample creations

the password vunerable .py will use https://api.pwnedpasswords.com
to check if a password is known to have been hacked. This doesn't validate against any password complexity requirements - that may be another project sometime

-- usage: python3 password_vunerable.py testpasswordtext

-- returns True if hacked along with count, False if not known to be hacked
